As luck would have it, a rich girl Ritu (Tanushree Dutta) arrives in their neighborhood with her grandparents. All four set out with their individual plans to marry her but end up discovering a shocking truth. Ritu came to the city to find about her brother Rahul's killers.
All four of them try to impress Ritu but meanwhile, they discover that Rahul died along with his friend Jaishankar "Jai" Yadav. They try hard and finally Pankaj is decided to marry Ritu. Soon before marriage, Ritu finds the secret that Rahul and Jai were in contact with a notorious gang leader Zikomo Singh (Murali Sharma). Also, Ritu finds that the four were bluffing all time just to impress her and so she starts avoiding them. One day Zikomo Singh finds them and kidnaps Ritu and her grandparents. He reveals himself to be the true killer and he confesses about killing Rahul and Jai. He asks for them to hand over a drum if they wanted to see him alive, but Ritu's family members do not know about any drum. A fight ensues and Zikomo Singh is killed in a self-explosion in the end. Ritu hands over the drum and the four of them find it filled with money, realizing that Zikomo Singh was after the money and not the drum. They run behind Ritu's car after she leaves, as the film ends.
