                <br>  A maraca (pronunciation (help·info)), sometimes called rumba shaker or chac-chac,[1] is a rattle which appears in many genres of Caribbean and Latin music. 
            </br>
                <br>It is shaken by a handle and usually played as part of a pair.
Maracas (from Guaraní mbaracás),[2] also known as tamaracas, were rattles of divination, an oracle of the Brazilian Tupinamba indigenous, found also with other native tribes, such as the Guarani, Orinoco and in Florida.
A maraca player in Spanish is a maraquero.</br>
