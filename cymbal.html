               <br> A cymbal is a common percussion instrument. Often used in pairs, cymbals consist of thin, normally round plates of various alloys. The majority of cymbals are of indefinite pitch, although small disc-shaped cymbals based on ancient designs sound a definite note (such as crotales). Cymbals are used in many ensembles ranging from the orchestra, percussion ensembles, jazz bands, heavy metal bands, and marching groups. Drum kits usually incorporate at least a crash, ride, or crash/ride, and a pair of hi-hat cymbals. A player of cymbals is known as a cymbalist.
                Cymbals have existed since ancient times.

                <br>  Representations of cymbals may be found in reliefs and paintings from Armenian Highlands (7th century BC[5]), Larsa, Babylon, Assyria, ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, and ancient Rome. References to cymbals also appear throughout the Bible, through many Psalms and songs of praise to God. Cymbals may have been introduced to China from Central Asia in the 3rd or 4th century AD.[4]
                In India, Cymbals have been in use since ancient times and are still used across almost all major temples and Buddhist sites. Gigantic Aartis along the Ganges which are revered by Hindus all over the world, are incomplete without large cymbals.
                Cymbals were employed by Turkish janissaries in the 14th century or earlier.

                <br>   By the 17th century, such cymbals were used in European music, and more commonly played in military bands and orchestras by the mid 18th century. Since the 19th century, some composers have called for larger roles for cymbals in musical works, and a variety of cymbal shapes, techniques, and hardware have been developed in response.[4]
