               <br> Bongos (Spanish: bong√≥) are an Afro-Cuban percussion instrument consisting of a pair of small open bottomed hand drums of different sizes. They are struck with both hands, most commonly in an eight-stroke pattern called martillo (hammer). They are mainly employed in the rhythm section of son cubano and salsa ensembles, often alongside other drums such as the larger congas and the stick-struck timbales.
                Bongo drummers (bongoseros[1]) emerged as the only drummers of son cubano ensembles in eastern Cuba toward the end of the 19th century.

               <br> The instrument remained important as son groups evolved into larger conjuntos and orchestras in Havana in the 1940s, at which point they began to share the stage with congas. Bongos later reached the United States, where they are commonly played in salsa, Afro-Cuban jazz, Latin rock and other genres.[2]
                Bongo drums are about 20 centimetres (8 in) high and have diameters of approximately 20 centimetres (8 in) and 25 centimetres (10 in) (the smaller drum is called macho, male, and the larger drum, hembra, female).[3][4][5] They are the smallest drums in Latin percussion, some models being only 15 centimetres (6 in) in diameter.[6] The shells of the drums and the bridge (the small block that joins them) are usually made of wood, although fiberglass is also common. The heads are typically made of calfskin and attached to the shells via steel hardware that enables their tuning. Originally, metal tacks were used, so tuning had to be done by heating the skins
