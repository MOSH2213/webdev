                <br>The esraj (from the Punjabi: ਇਸਰਾਜ) is an Indian stringed instrument found in two forms throughout the Indian subcontinent. It is a relatively recent instrument, being only about 300 years old. It is found in North India, primarily Punjab, where it is used in Sikh music and Hindustani classical compositions and in West Bengal. The esraj is a modern variant of the dilruba, differing slightly in structure.
The dilruba and its variant, the esraj, had been declining in popularity for many decades.

By the 1980s, the instrument was nearly extinct. However, with the rising influence of the "Gurmat Sangeet" movement in an effort to revive the traditional instrumentation of Sikh Kirtan, the instrument has been once again attracting attention.

In West Bengal, Rabindranath Tagore made this instrument mandatory for all the students of the Sangeet Bhavan (Music Academy) in Visva-Bharati University (otherwise known as Shantiniketan). Because of this, Esraj is considered the main accompanying instrument for traditional Rabindra Sangeet
The dilruba and its variant, the esraj, have a similar yet distinct construction style, with each having a medium-sized sitar-like neck with 20 heavy metal frets. This neck carries a long wooden rack of 12–15 sympathetic strings, known as the taraf strings, and 2-3 jawari strings. By the jawari strings, one can give emphasis on the vadi, samvadi, and nayeshwar notes, but jawari strings may not always be present. Jawari helps in producing a more piercing sound. The dilruba has more sympathetic strings, and a differently shaped body than the esraj. The esraj has four main strings while the dilruba has 6 both which are bowed. All strings are metal. The soundboard is a stretched piece of goatskin similar to what is found on a sarangi. Occasionally, the instrument has a gourd affixed to the top for balance or for tone enhancement.
