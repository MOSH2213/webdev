                <br>     The harp is a stringed musical instrument that has a number of individual strings running at an angle to its soundboard; the strings are plucked with the fingers. Harps can be made and played in various ways, standing or sitting and in orchestras or concerts. Its most common form is triangular in shape and made of wood. Some have multiple rows of strings and pedal attachments.
                The earliest harps and lyres were found in Sumer, 3500 BCE,[2]

                <br>    and several harps were excavated from burial pits and royal tombs in Ur.[3] The oldest depictions of harps without a forepillar can be seen adjacent to the Near East, in the wall paintings of ancient Egyptian tombs in the Nile Valley, which date from as early as 3000 BCE.[4] These murals show an instrument that closely resembles the hunter's bow, without the pillar that we find in modern harps. [5] The chang flourished in Persia in many forms from its introduction, about 4000 BCE, until the 17th century.
                By the start of the Common Era, "robust, vertical, angular harps", which had become predominant in the Hellenistic world, were cherished in the Sasanian court. In the last century of the Sasanian period, angular harps were redesigned to make them as light as possible ("light, vertical, angular harps"); while they became more elegant, they lost their structural rigidity. At the height of the Persian tradition of illustrated book production (1300â€“1600 CE), such light harps were still frequently depicted, although their use as musical instruments was reaching its end.[
